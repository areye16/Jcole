           <div class="about">J.Cole is a rapper born in Germany and raised in North Carolina. He found inspiration in music from a young age which led him to pursure a career in music. He originally gave JayZ his mixtape, which ended with JayZ saying "get that shit out my face!" JayZ was later shown a mixtape of a young man and ended up digging his vibe. This artist turned out to be JCole. He signed with Roc Nation and produced his first major album which entered Billboards top 100 in the first week in 2007. He then went on to create his own Record label known as Dreamville records: an ode to his hometown. He uses the profits from his label to help his community. He provides rent-free living in his old house on Forest Hills Dr. </div>
