           <div class="about">J.Cole is a rapper born in Germany and raised in North Carolina. He found inspiration in music from a young age which led him to pursure a career in music. He originally gave JayZ his mixtape, which ended with JayZ saying "get that shit out my face!" JayZ was later shown a mixtape of a young man and ended up digging his vibe. This artist turned out to be JCole. He signed with Roc Nation and produced his first major album which entered Billboards top 100 in the first week in 2007. He then went on to create his own Record label known as Dreamville records: an ode to his hometown. He uses the profits from his label to help his community. He provides rent-free living in his old house on Forest Hills Dr. </div>
            
           <div class="info-box">
        
          <p>J.Cole's parents divorced when he was a baby, and his mother remarried and they moved to Lafeytte, North Carolina. She later got divorced and moved to a trailer park. J.Cole recalls living in the area and knowing the situation wasn't the best and a terrifying place for a white woman in a neighborhood majority black. His mother was later able to purchase a small house on Forest Hills Dr. J.Cole's mother later lost the home from foreclosure. Years later once J.Cole arose to stardom he purchased the house, titled his third studio album after the address, which went 3x platinum, and through the Dreamville Foundation he gives teh home to single mother's with kids a place to live rent free for two years. He also provides a ocal book club to the kids in the area so they are invited to learn and strive outside and inside the classroom.
